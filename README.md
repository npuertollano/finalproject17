Nixon Puertollano's final project for programming. MHS Freshman Year Simulator.
  Go through the first year of Magnet and overcome the challenges that come with being a freshman.
Starts with creating your character, with the user choosing their name, town, and class. Choose
from Gamer, Intellectual, or Athlete. From here, you can choose what you want to focus on in
your first year. Your decisions and interactions reflect what person you become and what happens
in your first year. You can choose to study, go to the gym, play games, or socialize with other
students in school.
